/// C API for BertQuestionAnswerer.
///
/// The API leans towards simplicity and uniformity instead of convenience, as
/// most usage will be by language-specific wrappers. It provides largely the
/// same set of functionality as that of the C++ TensorFlow Lite
/// `BertQuestionAnswerer` API, but is useful for shared libraries where having
/// a stable ABI boundary is important.
///
/// Usage:
/// <pre><code>
/// // Create the model and interpreter options.
/// BertQuestionAnswerer* qa_answerer =
///   BertQuestionAnswererFromFile("/path/to/model.tflite");
///
/// // answer a question.
/// QaAnswers* answers = Answer(qa_answerer, context, question);
///
/// // Dispose of the API and QaAnswers objects.
/// BertQuestionAnswererDelete(qa_answerer);
/// BertQuestionAnswererQaAnswersDelete(answers);
